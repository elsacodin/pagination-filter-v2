FULL-STACK-JS Project-2
Hi everyone, here is my second project.
Pagination & content filter

I tried to tackle the exceeds expectations

Pagination:
You can try with the number of students you want.
I set up a variable which hold the number of student per page, so you can play with it to check if the number of link is correct.

SEARCH:
You search by name, email, by full name or few letters, lowerCase or upper... Even the @ symbole.
If there is no match you'll find a displayed message, I had a css rule
If you click search button without any word in it you'll display the ten first student...

Enjoy
